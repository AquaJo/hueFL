# hueFL

hueFL allows you to control Zigbee lamps and other devices controlled over a hue-bridge. All this comes shipped with a quite intuitive, minimal, sleek design & optional settings.\
Requires Java for some huge features like desktop background color- & dimm- syncing.\
Its a project from more than a year ago I decided to pay attention to again now to bring it to a **more** publishable & stable state.\
Its not exactly there where I wanted it, but at the moment I have some other projects running ^^

TODO:

- github actions with minimal install only
- ABRUPT CLOSING WONT KILL JAVA PROCESS!!
- // MAYBE FIX / REWRITE URL-HANDLING
- UNAUTH API KEY!!!!
- Maybe set asar to true again and fix its zip stuff or whatever the reason of breaking is (on github actions and preferably dev-local-wise)
- `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`
